		<h4>A note on Web Standards</h4>
		<p>The web, as it stands in it's current form, is quite the hot mess.
		The integral part of this project, which was to test the HTML5
		Vibrate API and it's effect on social engineering attacks, broke down
		and simply would not work as they were unsupported on that platform at
		the time of testing.</p>
		<p>The goal with implementing what we did (with white box testing),
		however, was to create a platform that was ready for when these
		standards become available to developers on their respective
		platforms.</p>

		<h4>A note on Social Engineering</h4>
		<p>The central goal of this project was to see the effect of a
		legitimate looking phone call (even if it was run in the browser) on
		everyday users.
		<h5>Testing it on Friends</h5>

		<h4>Challenges</h4>

		<h5>Development Enivornment</h5>
		<p>While static web pages running Javascript seem simple in nature, we
		did not have much experience in these environments. So, when it came
		time to do development, we ran into a lot of impediments as members
		learned the web technologies used.</p>
		<p>While version control systems, especially distributed ones, offer
		many advantages over other forms of sharing code bases, they can cause
		issues when individual group members are not familiar with the
		technology. This was the case when learning git.</p>

		<h5>Compatability</h5>
		<p>Initially, we ran into challenges using the HTML5 vibrate API, and
		had to manually test out each individual device and browser
		compatibility, which lead to iterations taking a fairly reasonable
		amount of time. To alleviate some of this, we made a user agent test
		page that returned the user agent of whoever visited, so we could
		easily tell browsers apart. Again, this was time consuming and could
		not be easily <i>scripted,</i> or automated.</p>
